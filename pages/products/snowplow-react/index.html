                        <small><b>Multiple platforms and channels. </b><br class="visible-lg" />You engage with your users across multiple platforms and channels. So you need to react to your users, coherently, across all those platforms and channels.</small>

                        <small><b>Multiple third party APIs. </b><br class="visible-lg" />It is common to use third party SaaS providers to manage marketing channels like email, push, display ads etc. Personalizing a user experience across all of them means working with multiple different APIs and protocols provides significant technical overhead.</small>

                        <small><b>Speed of response matters. </b><br class="visible-lg" />The faster you react to an insight e.g. that a user is at risk of churning, the more likely that reaction is to be successful. But reacting in real-time is not technically simple.</small>
