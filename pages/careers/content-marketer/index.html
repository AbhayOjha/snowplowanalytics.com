<h1>Content Marketer</h1>
<h4>London</h4>

<p>At Snowplow, we build technology that gives our users control of their digital event data, so they can use data to do incredible things.</p>

<p>To date, Snowplow has been used primarily by a group of pioneering, fast-growing, technically-sophisticated and data-savvy customers. As we move into the next phase of our growth, we need to get better at explaining to more traditional companies, across a range of geographies and sectors, what opportunities there for them to use data to differentiate and how we can work with them to support them realizing those opportunities.</p>

<p>Content is essential to doing that. We need to produce and market a range of material that:
<ul>
	<li>Highlights what our users have already achieved, using our technology</li>
	<li>Sketches out new possibilities</li>
	<li>Provides people interested in data with clear, jargon free idea of not only what is possible, but how practically it can be achieved.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We want to produce a range of content across different media (written incl. case studies, blog posts, presentations), podcasts, videos, live presentations) in collaboration with our internal teams, our partner network and users.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<p>You will:</p>
<ul class="styled">
	<li><strong>Create content that drives growth at Snowplow.</strong> We use our own technology to track how users engage with our own content and what impact it has on driving leads, sales and usage of our technology and services. You would have that data and tool set at your disposal, so would be able to develop a good understanding of how successful each content item that you produce is, and use that to inform.</li>
	<li><strong>Work with our internal data analytics and data engineering services teams, partners and customer to co-produce content</strong>. Our ecosystem havs a wealth of insight and experience that is excellent raw material for creating content. Finding effective ways to work with them will be key to multiplying your potential content output.</li>
	<li><strong>Work collaboratively with the rest of our growth team (which encompasses marketing, sales and customer success) to drive growth at Snowplow.</strong> We want to systematically target specific verticals and use cases. You would play an active role as part of that team, informing the strategic direction of that team and ensuring we have the right content in place to support each stage in that strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we’re looking for</h3>

<p>We’d love to get to know you if:</p>
<ul class="styled">
	<li><strong>You are delivery focused.</strong> You get stuff done and delivered, and move onto the next deliverable.</li>

	<li><strong>You have a passion for data and technology.</strong> You are excited about the transformational impact of data and want to work to work in data and technology. We want your passion to shine through in the content you produce.</li>
	<li><strong>You love to learn.</strong> Our company culture emphasizes learning by doing. You will be given enormous opportunities to develop your experience and grow your role at Snowplow.</li>
	<li><strong>You want to work for a fast-growing startup.</strong></li>
