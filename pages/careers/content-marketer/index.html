<h1>Content Marketer</h1>
<h4>London</h4>

<p>At Snowplow, we build technology that gives our users control of their digital event data, so they can use data to do incredible things.</p>

<p>To date, Snowplow has been used primarily by a group of pioneering, fast-growing, technically-sophisticated and data-savvy customers. As we move into the next phase of our growth, we need to get better at explaining to more traditional companies, across a range of geographies and sectors, what opportunities there for them to use data to differentiate and how we can work with them to support them realizing those opportunities.</p>

<p>Content is essential to doing that. We need to produce and market a range of material that:
<ul>
	<li>Highlights what our users have already achieved, using our technology</li>
	<li>Sketches out new possibilities</li>
	<li>Provides people interested in data with clear, jargon free idea of not only what is possible, but how practically it can be achieved.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We want to produce a range of content across different media (written incl. case studies, blog posts, presentations), podcasts, videos, live presentations) in collaboration with our internal teams, our partner network and users.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<p>You will:</p>
<ul class="styled">
	<li><strong>Create content that drives growth at Snowplow.</strong> Case studies, sales decks, interviews with users and partners, podcasts, thought pieces and more. We need to educate the digital analytics industry as a whole what is possible if they take control fo their data, and how in practice to realise those possibilities. There's a lot of people to persuade, and a lot of content to produce to help us make that case.</li>
	<li><strong>Work with our internal data analytics and data engineering services teams, partners and customers to co-produce content</strong>. Our ecosystem havs a wealth of insight and experience that is excellent raw material for creating content. Finding effective ways to work with them will be key to multiplying your potential content output.</li>
	<li><strong>Work collaboratively with the rest of our growth team (which encompasses marketing, sales and customer success) to drive growth at Snowplow.</strong> We want to systematically target specific verticals and use cases. You would play an active role as part of that team, informing the strategic direction of that team and ensuring we have the right content in place to support each stage in that strategy.</li>
	<li><strong>Go to events, learn, meet and engage with our customers, partners and the broader technology and data ecosystem.</strong> It's important that you're plugged in to the broader community and understand how the industry as a whole is evolving so you can write content that is informed and places us clearly in that evolving landscape.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we’re looking for</h3>

	<li><strong>You love to write content!</strong> We want you to produce a lot of different types of content, including podcasts and videos. But writing will make up a big chunk of what we need you to produce, and it's important you enjoy writing.</li>
	<li><strong>You are good at explaining complicated concepts in a simple, easy to understand way.</strong> The data and technology space is full of hard to understand content that makes it almost impossible for people trying to understand the space to see the wood from the trees. We want our content to be geniunely helpful, clear and authoritative: a useful resource for anyone interested in using data to do things better.</li>
	<li><strong>You are delivery focused.</strong> You get stuff done and delivered, and move onto the next deliverable.</li>
	<li><strong>You communicate with clarity and precision.</strong> You are an excellent communicator: both spoken and written, with an ability to explain complicated technical concepts simply and clearly.</li>

	<li><strong>You are independent and able to self-manage.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>You enjoy working as part of a team</strong></li>
</ul>
