<h1>Technical Product Manager, Data Engineering</h1>
<h4>Remote, UTC-3 - UTC+3 or London, UK</h4>

<p>Over the past five years Snowplow has grown into the industry-leading open-source event data pipeline, consisting of a dizzying array of user-facing products and SDKs, software libraries, general-purpose infrastructure tools. Together these projects represent an open source "estate" of over forty projects, with a strong bias towards data engineering.</p>

<p>We are looking for our first technical product manager (TPM) to help us to manage this complexity, to maintain our impressive release velocity even as our team grows, and to proactively extend and re-architect our platform to ensure that it stays relevant over the next decade.</p>

<p>This role is more technical than many product management positions. Snowplow is not a packaged SaaS product - instead, our various user constituencies (data analysts, developers, devops) interact with the platform via SQL, software SDKs and public APIs; being open source, the Snowplow codebase is itself an important user-facing aspect of the product.</p>

<p>Our first Technical Product Manager will work across our core open-source projects of Snowplow, Sauna and Iglu, plus our various data engineering projects and libraries which complement and power these systems.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<p>Responsibilities for our first technical product manager will include:</p>

<ul class="styled">
	<li>Collaborating with Snowplow’s co-founders to formalise the feature roadmap and release sequencing across our tier-one open-source projects</li>
	<li>Becoming the product owner for specific Snowplow data engineering projects, including some of: Snowplow, Sauna, Iglu, Snowplow Mini, Tupilak, SQL Runner, Dataflow Runner</li>
	<li>Writing detailed technical specifications for new features, capabilities and products</li>
	<li>Working closely with Data Engineering to design, build and QA new releases</li>
	<li>Proposing, testing and iterating new ideas with the Snowplow community via our new RFC process</li>
	<li>Working closely with Customer Success and Support Engineering to capture, define and prioritise feature requests from Snowplow customers
	<li>Communicating new releases to the community via blog posts, detailed tutorials and in person at conferences and meet-ups</li>
</ul>

<p>Product Management is a new team at Snowplow - and this first role is a great opportunity to work closely with a fast-growing startup’s founding team on the design and evolution of an enterprise-grade open-source software stack.</p>

<p>We would love to get to know you if:</p>

<ul class="styled">
	<li><strong>You are deeply technical.</strong> You may not code regularly, but you have a deep familiarity across the software stack, you understand and respect open source, and you are comfortable working side-by-side with software engineers</li>
	<li><strong>You have a strong product sensibility.</strong> This is not a project management role - we are looking for creative candidates who understand how to craft raw software projects into compelling user-facing products</li>
	<li><strong>You are highly experienced at software delivery.</strong> You are confident managing a release roadmap, you can hold software engineers to account, and you understand the importance of small batches and minimizing work-in-process</li>
	<li><strong>You are a creative problem solver.</strong> Oftentimes at Snowplow we are solving a problem for the first time - there is no prior art to draw on, so we need to come up with solutions ourselves</li>
	<li><strong>You communicate with clarity and enthusiasm.</strong> There are few stakeholders inside or outside of Snowplow that this role does <strong>not</strong> interact with. In particular, our customers, users and contributors are highly technology- and data-literate and expect high-quality communication and collaboration with our team</li>
</ul>
