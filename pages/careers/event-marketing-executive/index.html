<h2 class="h1">Event Marketing Executive</h2>
<h4>London</h4>

<p>At Snowplow, we build technology that gives our users control of their digital event data, so they can use data to do incredible things.</p>

<p>To date, Snowplow has been used primarily by a group of pioneering, fast-growing, technically-sophisticated and data-savvy customers. As we move into the next phase of our growth, we need to get better at explaining to more traditional companies, across a range of geographies and sectors, what opportunities there for them to use data to differentiate and how we can work with them to support them realizing those opportunities.</p>

<p>Events play a key role in our marketing strategy:
<ul>
	<li>We organise our own events and meetups across a large number of cities globally.</li>
	<li>We sponsor, speak at and participate in meetups and events organised by other companies including partners and industry associations.</li>
</ul>
</p>

	<li><strong>Work collaboratively with the rest of our growth team (which encompasses marketing, sales and customer success) to drive growth at Snowplow.</strong> We want to systematically target specific verticals and use cases. You would play an active role as part of that team, informing the strategic direction of that team and ensuring we the work you do on the events and digital marketing side support that overall strategy.</li>
</ul>
