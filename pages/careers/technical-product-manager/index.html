<h1>Technical Product Manager</h1>
<h4>London, UK</h4>

<p>Over the past four years Snowplow has grown into the industry-leading open-source event data pipeline, consisting of a dizzying array of user-facing products and SDKs, software libraries, general-purpose infrastructure tools, plus the proprietary products supporting our Managed Service.</p>

<p>We are looking for our first technical product manager to help us to manage this complexity and to maintain our impressive release velocity even as our team grows.</p>

<p>This role is more technical than many product management positions. Snowplow is not a packaged SaaS product - instead, our various user constituencies (data analysts, developers, devops) interact with the platform via SQL, software SDKs and public APIs; being open source, the Snowplow codebase is itself an important user-facing aspect of the product.</p>

<p>Responsibilities for our first technical product manager will include:</p>

<ul class="styled">
	<li>Collaborating with Snowplow’s co-founders to formalise the product roadmap and release sequencing across all Snowplow projects</li>
	<li>Becoming the product owner for specific Snowplow projects, including potentially: new data sources for Snowplow; Snowplow Mini; our new product Sauna; our Managed Service customer dashboard</li>
	<li>Working closely with Product Engineering and Infrastructure Engineering to deliver new releases</li>
	<li>Writing detailed technical specifications for new features and products</li>
	<li>Testing and iterating ideas with the Snowplow community via our new RFC process</li>
	<li>Providing thorough QA and feedback to Engineering on new release candidates</li>
	<li>Communicating new releases to the community via blog posts, detailed tutorials and in person at conferences and meet-ups</li>
</ul>

<p>Product Management is a new team at Snowplow - and this first role is a great opportunity to work closely with a fast-growing startup’s founding team on the design and evolution of an enterprise-grade open-source software stack.</p>

<p>We would love to get to know you if:</p>

<ul class="styled">
	<li><strong>You are deeply technical.</strong> You may not code regularly, but you have a deep familiarity across the software stack, you understand and respect open source, and you are comfortable working side-by-side with software engineers</li>
	<li><strong>You have a strong product sensibility.</strong> This is not a project management role - we are looking for creative candidates who understand how to craft raw software projects into compelling user-facing products</li>
	<li><strong>You are highly experienced at software delivery.</strong> You are confident managing a release roadmap, you can hold software engineers to account, and you understand the importance of small batches and minimizing work-in-process</li>
	<li><strong>You communicate with clarity and enthusiasm.</strong> Snowplow customers, users and contributors are highly technology- and data-literate and expect high-quality communication and collaboration with our team</li>
</ul>
