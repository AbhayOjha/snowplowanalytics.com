		<h3>Join our team and empower a generation of Smart People to Differentiate with Data.</h3>
		<p>At Snowplow, we believe in the transformative potential of data. Data drives insight and insight drives opportunity.</p>
		<p>Using data effectively is a creative as well as technical exercise: it starts with asking the right questions. Smart People at the heart of every successful data program. Unfortunately at too many companies, Smart People get tied up doing boring data-related tasks: wrestling data out of silo'd systems, ingesting it into warehouses and analytics engines and joining it with other data sets so that useful things can then be done with it.</p>
		<p>We build technology that gives Smart People control of their own data. So they can focus on what Smart People are best at: being creative, asking the right question, choosing the analysis technique suitable for answering the question, running the analysis, interpreting the results and acting on those results.</p>
		<p>Come join our team and help empower the next generation of Smart Digital analysts, scientists, engineers, marketers, product managers and more differentiate with data.</p>
