              <h3>Guidelines</h3>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Make sure it’s okay inside your own organization to share your stories before we publish.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Ideally a blog post should be no longer than 2,000 words – if you have more to say, that’s great, write two posts!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Aim for informative content that’s helpful to others.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Build a coherent structure into your writing that makes sense and is easy to follow. Please avoid curse words or slang.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Make your writing accessible – avoid the overuse of jargon or acronyms. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>It’s not obligatory to mention Snowplow, but it’s great if you do.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Share real-life examples! It’s always great to hear about your experience.</p>
