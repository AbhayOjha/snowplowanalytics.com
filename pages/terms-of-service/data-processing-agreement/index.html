<h1>
    Snowplow Analytics Data Processing Agreement
</h1>
<h3>
    1. Interpretation
</h3>
<p>
    1.1 In this agreement:
</p>
<p>
    “<b>Customer</b>” has the meaning given to it in the Service Agreement;
</p>
<p>
    "<b>Data Privacy Laws</b>" means the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic
    Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003/2426, any amendment,
    consolidation, re-enactment or replacement thereof, and any other
    legislation of equivalent purpose or effect enacted in the United Kingdom,
    or, where relevant, the European Union;
</p>
<p>
    "<b>GDPR</b>" means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as
    applied, supplemented, modified and/or replaced by the laws of England (or,
    where applicable, those of a relevant EU member state) from time to time;
</p>
<p>
    "<b>Personal Data</b>" has the meaning given to it by the GDPR, but will
    only include personal data to the extent that such personal data, or any
    part of such personal data, is processed in relation to the performance of
    the Service Agreement;
</p>
<p>
    “<b>Services</b>” means the services provided by Snowplow to the Customer
    under the Service Agreement;
</p>
<p>
    “<b>Service Agreement</b>” means the agreement between Snowplow and the
    Customer for the performance of certain services involving the processing
    by Snowplow of personal data on behalf of the Customer;
</p>
<p>
    “<b>Snowplow</b>” means Snowplow Analytics Limited, an English company with
    company number 07852221, or if different the Snowplow affiliate which is
    party to the Service Agreement; and
</p>
<p>
    otherwise, words and phrases with defined meanings in the GDPR have the
    same meanings when used in this agreement.
</p>
<p>
    1.2 In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Service
    Agreement and terms of this data processing agreement, the terms of this
    data processing agreement will govern.
</p>
<h3>
    2. Particulars of Personal Data to be processed
</h3>
<p>
    2.1 The parties agree (for informational purposes only, and without
    creating additional obligations on either party or limiting the rights and
    obligations of either party otherwise existing), the following particulars
    of the Personal Data to be processed.
</p>
<p>
2.2 The    <b>nature and purpose of the processing to be carried out by Snowplow </b>
    is provision of a data analytics pipeline service, as more particularly
    described in the Service Agreement and the service description documents
    referenced in it. The purpose for which that data analytics pipeline is
    used is determined by the Customer.
</p>
<p>
    2.3 The <b>duration of processing</b> is the term of the Service Agreement
    and any period of transitional service provision.
</p>
<p>
    2.4 Prior to any use of the Services with real Personal Data, the Customer
    will register with Snowplow, through Snowplow’s prescribed method from time
    to time, the categories of Personal Data which it has configured the
    Services to collect, and the categories of data subjects whose personal
    data it is, and will update that registration without delay if it
    configures the Services to collect different or additional categories of
    Personal Data, and/or Personal Data from different or additional categories
    of data subjects. That registration is hereby incorporated by reference
    into this clause 5
</p>
<h3>
    3. Mutual Obligations
</h3>
<p>
    3.1 Each party will comply with the Data Privacy Laws applicable to it in
    connection with the Service Agreement, and will not cause the other party
    to breach any of its obligations under Data Privacy Laws.
</p>
<h3>
    4. Customer obligations
</h3>
<p>
    4.1 The Customer:
</p>
<p>
    4.1.1 will provide to Snowplow on demand all such information as Snowplow
    may reasonably request in connection with the performance of its
    obligations under this agreement, including but not limited to the
    information which Snowplow needs in order to comply with article 30(2) GDPR
    (if not already within Snowplow’s knowledge); and
</p>
<p>
    4.1.2 represents and warrants that all such information will be correct,
    complete and not misleading, and that it has disclosed to Snowplow all
    information relating to the Personal Data which is relevant to Snowplow’s
    performance of its obligations under this agreement or the Data Privacy
    Laws in respect of the Personal Data.
</p>
<p>
4.2 Without prejudice to the generality of clause 6 (    <i>Mutual Obligations</i>), the Customer will ensure that in respect of the
    Personal Data to be processed by Snowplow or its subcontractors under the
    Service Agreement:
</p>
<p>
    4.2.1 it has established and recorded a valid legal basis for that
    processing pursuant to article 6 GDPR;
</p>
<p>
    4.2.2 it has established and recorded a valid exemption for the processing
    of any special categories of Personal Data pursuant to article 9 GDPR;
</p>
<p>
    4.2.3 it has complied with and/or will prior to the commencement of
    processing comply with the information provision requirements of articles
    13 and 14 GDPR, and is able to demonstrate that compliance;
</p>
<p>
    4.2.4 it has complied with and/or will comply with article 22 GDPR in
    respect of any automated individual decision making in respect of the data
    subject, including profiling, which it may undertake in connection with the
    Personal Data;
</p>
<p>
    4.2.5 it secures those systems and services related to the Personal Data
    which are solely within the Customer’s control, and will secure those
    aspects of the Services and connected systems as are described as being the
Customer’s responsibility to secure in Snowplow’s document “    <i>GDPR: Securing data: A guide for Snowplow Insights customers</i>”, as
    updated or replaced from time to time;
</p>
<p>
    4.2.6 it has conducted and recorded any required privacy impact assessment,
    or has satisfied itself that no privacy impact assessment is required;
</p>
<p>
    4.2.7 it has made any required notifications to, and obtained any required
    permissions from, each relevant supervisory authority; and
</p>
<p>
    4.2.8 it has in place appropriate processes and procedures to enable it to
    comply with requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under
    GDPR, in particular their rights of objection, access and erasure.
</p>
<p>
    4.3 The Customer acknowledges and agrees that:
</p>
<p>
    4.3.1 it has reviewed and understood Snowplow’s provided documentation on
    the configuration of the Services, including but not limited to Snowplow’s
    documents “
    <i>
        GDPR: Understanding what data can be and is collected with Snowplow
        Insights
    </i>
    ”, “<i>GDPR: Understanding how Snowplow Insights processes data</i>” and “
    <i>
        GDPR: Approaches to data deletion and retention with Snowplow Insights
    </i>
    ”, as they may be updated or replaced from time to time (and Snowplow will
    draw significant updates or replacements to those documents to the
    Customer’s attention through some appropriate method);
</p>
<p>
    4.3.2 it is the Customer’s responsibility to determine what Personal Data
    will be processed by the Services, and how it will be processed, and to
    configure the Services accordingly (or to instruct Snowplow to configure
    them accordingly); and
</p>
<p>
    4.3.3 therefore, the lawfulness or otherwise of that processing is in large
    part determined by how the Customer chooses to use the Services, and
    Snowplow has no liability whatsoever arising out of or in connection with
    how the Customer chooses to configure or use the Services.
</p>
<p>
    4.4 The Customer must give all configuration instructions for the Services
    to Snowplow in writing (which term when used in this context includes email
    or raising a ticket with the Snowplow service desk).
</p>
<p>
    4.5 Snowplow acknowledges, and will comply with, its obligation under
    article 28(3) GDPR to inform the Customer if, in its opinion, an
    instruction given by the Customer infringes the Data Privacy Laws. However,
    the Customer acknowledges and agrees that Snowplow is not a law firm and
    does not give legal advice, and therefore Snowplow will have no liability
    whatsoever to the Customer arising out of or in connection with the content
    or effect of any such opinion, or whether or when any such opinion is given
    or not given, or otherwise arising out of or in connection with any such
    opinion in any way. Without prejudice to its other rights under this
    agreement, Snowplow reserves the right to decline to act (or to decline to
    continue to act) on an instruction of the Customer which it considers to be
    unlawful, but its failure to do so, or to do so by a particular time, will
    not be construed as a waiver of any of the Customer’s obligations under
    this clause 7.
</p>
<h3>
    5. Snowplow Obligations
</h3>
<p>

    5.1 Where Snowplow processes Personal Data (as processor) on behalf of
        the Customer (as controller) in connection with the Services, Snowplow
        will:
</p>
<p>
    5.1.1 process that Personal Data only in accordance with the written
    instructions for the configuration of the Services given to it by the
    Customer or (at the Customer’s cost) such different or additional
    instructions received in writing from the Customer from time to time. If
    compliance with such additional instructions prevents or hinders the
    performance of Snowplow’s obligations under this agreement, Snowplow will
    be excused from the performance of the affected obligations, without
    liability;
</p>
<p>
    5.1.2 ensure that all of its personnel with access to that Personal Data
    have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate
    statutory obligation of confidentiality;
</p>
<p>
        5.1.3 take the technical and organisational security measures to secure
        that Personal Data which are described as being Snowplow’s
responsibility in Snowplow’s document “        <i>GDPR: Securing data: A guide for Snowplow Insights customers</i>” as
        updated or replaced from time to time, the Customer acknowledging that
        it has reviewed that description and agrees that the measures described
        are appropriate and sufficient for the purposes of article 32 GDPR
    . Snowplow reserves the right to make reasonable changes to the precise
    security measures in place from time to time; for example it may implement
    additional measures to respond to new threats, or change how existing
    measures are implemented to reflect customer feedback or changes in best
    practice, or remove measures which no longer serve a useful purpose.
    Snowplow will inform the Customer of any material changes to the security
    measures in place, and will ensure that any such change does not materially
    reduce the overall level of security of those aspects of the Services that
    are Snowplow’s responsibility to secure;
</p>
<p>
    5.1.4 engage only those other processors which are set out in Snowplow’s
    customer support portal or which are subsequently engaged in accordance
    with paragraph 8.1.5 (each, a “<b>Sub-Processor</b>”) to process that
    Personal Data on its behalf, and provided always that:
</p>
<p>
    5.1.4.1 it binds any such Sub-Processor by a written agreement complying
    with the requirements of article 28 GDPR as it applies to that
    Sub-Processor’s processing activities; and
</p>
<p>
    5.1.4.2 Snowplow remains liable to the Customer for the acts and omissions
    of any Sub-Processor, as if they were the acts or omissions of Snowplow
    itself;
</p>
<p>
        5.1.5 where Snowplow wishes to engage a different or an additional
        Sub-Processor, first inform the Customer of the identity of the
        proposed Sub-Processor and provide the Customer with a reasonable
        opportunity to object to that Sub-Processor’s engagement. If the
        Customer does so object it will inform Snowplow within 14 days of being
        so informed, giving reasons for the objection, and if Snowplow cannot
        within 30 days of that objection address the reasons for it to the
        Customer’s reasonable satisfaction then Snowplow may choose not to
        appoint that Sub-Processor, or it may choose to appoint that
        Sub-Processor regardless, in which case the Customer will be entitled
        to terminate the Service Agreement by notice to Snowplow;
</p>
<p>
        5.1.6 taking into account the nature of the processing and insofar as
        is possible, assist the Customer (at the Customer’s cost) with the
        fulfilment of the Customer's obligation to respond to requests by data
        subjects to exercise their rights under the Data Privacy Laws over that
        Personal Data, by providing relevant information requested by the
        Customer and copies of relevant Personal Data requested by the Customer
        within a reasonable time and in a commonly used electronic format, in
        each case unless that information or relevant Personal Data is already
        accessible to the Customer without Snowplow’s intervention;
</p>
<p>
        5.1.7 taking into account the nature of the processing and the
        information available to Snowplow, assist the Customer (at the
        Customer’s cost) in carrying out privacy impact assessments pursuant to
        article 35 GDPR and prior consultations pursuant to article 36 GDPR in
        respect of that Personal Data, by providing such relevant information
        about the processing carried out by Snowplow as the Customer may
        reasonably request;
</p>
<p>
    5.1.8 inform the Customer of any personal data breach which occurs in
    respect of the Personal Data under Snowplow’s control without undue delay
    after becoming aware of it, providing sufficient details to enable the
    Customer to comply with its own notification obligations (and Snowplow may
    provide such details in stages as they become available to it, provided
    that it is reasonable to do so). The Customer acknowledges and agrees that
    Snowplow cannot proactively monitor for, and may not become aware of,
    personal data breaches caused by the Customer’s misuse or misconfiguration
    of Customer systems or the Services;
</p>
<p>
    5.1.9 after the termination of the Services, delete or return to the
    Customer (at the Customer's option and cost) all copies of the Personal
    Data in its possession or control, and procure that any relevant
    Sub-Processor does the same, unless the applicable laws of the United
    Kingdom or European Union require Snowplow or that Sub-Processor to retain
    a copy of it;
</p>
<p>
    5.1.10 make available to the Customer on demand all information reasonably
    necessary to demonstrate compliance with this clause 8, to the extent that
    it is not already available to the Customer; and
</p>
<p>
    5.1.11 allow the Customer, or its external auditor (subject to reasonable
    and appropriate confidentiality undertakings), to inspect and audit
    Snowplow’s data processing activities insofar as they relate to the
    Personal Data, to enable the Customer to verify that Snowplow is in
    compliance with this clause 8, provided that:
</p>
<p>
    5.1.11.1 the Customer may exercise that inspection and audit right no more
    frequently than once per calendar year, unless required by a supervisory
    authority;
</p>
<p>
    5.1.11.2 the Customer will meet Snowplow’s reasonable costs incurred as a
    result of any such inspection or audit, unless that inspection or audit
    shows Snowplow to be in breach of this clause 8;
</p>
<p>
    5.1.11.3 the Customer (or its auditor, as the case may be) will not thereby
    be entitled to access to personal data or confidential information of any
    other Snowplow customer, nor to direct access to any computer or storage
    system unless explicitly required by a supervisory authority;
</p>
<p>
    5.1.11.4 the Customer (or its auditor, as the case may be) complies with
    Snowplow’s reasonable policies while onsite, including its safety and
    security policies; and
</p>
<p>
    5.1.11.5 any information coming into the Customer’s possession (or that of
    its auditor, as the case may be) as a result of such inspection or audit
    will be and remain the Confidential Information of Snowplow for the
    purposes of the Service Agreement, and the Customer will (and will procure
    that its auditor will, as the case may be) treat it accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    5.2 Snowplow and the Customer acknowledge their mutual obligations under
    Chapter V GDPR in relation to international transfers of Personal Data, and
    agree to address those obligations as follows. Snowplow will store the
    Personal Data in the geographical region selected by the Customer. If that
    geographical region is in the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area,
    Snowplow will not transfer it outside of the United Kingdom or the European
    Economic Area without the Customer’s prior written agreement, in which case
    Snowplow and the Customer agree to enter into such arrangement as may
    reasonably be required to provide adequate safeguards in respect of that
    transfer, such as entry into standard-form contracts governing such
    transfers which have been approved by the EU Commission and/or the UK
    Information Commissioner (as the case may be).
</p>
<h3>
    6. Indemnity
</h3>
<p>
        6.1 The Customer will indemnify and hold harmless Snowplow from and
        against any and all losses, damage, liability, costs (including
        reasonable legal fees) and expenses incurred by Snowplow or on its
        behalf as a result of a claim brought against Snowplow based on any
        breach by the Customer of clause 7 (<i>Customer Obligations</i>).
</p>
<h3>
    7. Liability
</h3>
<p>
    7.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Service Agreement, the
    Customer’s liabilities and obligations under the indemnity in clause 9
    above shall not be limited or excluded in any way.
</p>
<h3>
    8. Term and Termination
</h3>
<p>
    8.1 This agreement will have effect from the date of the last signature
    below until the Service Agreement is terminated or expires, whereupon it
    will terminate automatically.
</p>
<p>
    8.2 A material breach of this agreement will constitute a material breach
    of the Service Agreement for the purposes of the termination rights set out
    in the Service Agreement.
</p>
<h3>
    9. General
</h3>
<p>
    9.1 Except as expressly provided in this agreement, any failure to exercise
    or delay in exercising (whether fully or at all) a right or remedy provided
    by this agreement or by law does not constitute a waiver of the right or
    remedy or a waiver of any other rights or remedies.
</p>
<p>
    9.2 A person who is not a party to this agreement has no right under the
    Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this
    agreement.
</p>
<p>
    9.3 This agreement and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
    connection with it are governed by English law and subject to the exclusive
    jurisdiction of the English courts.
</p>
