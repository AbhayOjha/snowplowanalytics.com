	person to):
</p>
<p>
	2.3.1 reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or translate any Product, or

	provided always that the Customer may not use any Product to compete,
	directly or indirectly, with Snowplow; or
</p>
<p>
	2.3.3 use or deal with any Product in any way which is unlawful in any
	relevant jurisdiction, or to process any Customer Data which is unlawful,
	defamatory, harassing, obscene
</p>
<h2>
	3. Software Licence
</h2>
<p>
	3.1 This clause 3 applies if and only to the extent that the relevant
	Product includes Software.
</p>
<p>
	3.2 Snowplow grants to the Customer a non-exclusive, non-assignable
	licence to Use the Software as part of the Product from the Effective
	Date until Termination, only for the Customer’s own internal business

	3.3 Snowplow expressly reserves the right to incorporate into the Software

</p>
<p>
	3.4 Snowplow may ship or otherwise make available with the Software certain

	and is licensed on the terms set out or referred to in Snowplow’s Open

</p>
<p>
	4.3.2 the Hosted Services are dependent upon the relevant Cloud Computing
	Platform and/or other third party cloud providers which are beyond
	Snowplow’s ability to control, and that Snowplow will consequently have no
	liability to the Customer arising out of or in connection with
	unavailability or slow performance of the Hosted Services attributable to a
	relevant Cloud Computing Platform and/or such other third party providers.

	Product includes Support.
</p>
<p>
	5.2 Snowplow will use its reasonable efforts to provide Support in
	accordance with its support policy as set out in the applicable Product
	Description. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the support policy
	is subject to change from time to time, provided that if during the Initial
	Term Snowplow changes it in a way which results in a significantly lower
	level of Support for the relevant Product, then those changes will not come
	into effect as against the Customer until the start of the next Further
	Term.
</p>
<p>
	5.3 Where the scope of Support (as set out in the Product Description)
	includes initial set-up, Snowplow will, subject to the Customer’s

</p>
<p>
	6.1.1 perform the Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services selected on
	the Order Form (and as further described in the Statement of Work, if
	applicable) with reasonable skill and care;
</p>
<p>
	6.1.2 use reasonable efforts to complete the Data Analytics and Data
	Engineering Services within the Customer’s requested timeframes, but time
	will not be of the essence; and
</p>
<p>
	6.1.3 where Snowplow personnel work at the Customer’s premises in the
	course of providing the Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services,
	comply with (a) the Customer’s written policies and procedures provided to
	Snowplow in advance of such visit; and (b) the Customer’s reasonable
	instructions in respect of the conduct of Snowplow’s personnel while at the
	Customer’s premises, and the Customer will accordingly ensure that it
	provides such Snowplow personnel with a safe and lawful working
	environment.
</p>
<p>
	6.2 Where the Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services entail
	integrating a Product with third party software and/or services, Snowplow
	will not be responsible for any failure or delay which is wholly or mainly
	caused by defects in such third party software and/or services, or the
	failure of any relevant third party vendor or supplier to provide
	reasonable cooperation and assistance. Any new or increased charges levied
	by any third party vendor or supplier by reason of providing such
	cooperation and assistance will be the sole responsibility of the Customer.
</p>
<p>
	6.3 Where Snowplow personnel are required to travel in order to perform
	Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services, the Customer will reimburse
	Snowplow for such personnel’s out of pocket costs and expenses, provided
	that:
</p>
<p>
	6.3.1 they are reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount; and
</p>
<p>
	6.3.2 the Customer has approved them in advance.
</p>
<h2>
	7. Charges
</h2>
<p>
	7.1 Unless otherwise specified in the Order Form, Snowplow will invoice the
	Customer as follows:
</p>
<p>
	7.1.1 for the initial setup Charges (if any) in respect of a Product, on or
	shortly after the Effective Date or (if relevant) on or shortly after Go
	Live for the relevant Product;
</p>
<p>
	7.1.2 for the recurring Charges in respect of a Product, monthly in advance
	on or shortly after the first working day of each month; and

<p>
	7.1.3 for Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services in full in advance
	or as otherwise specified in the Statement of Work (if any).
</p>
<p>
	7.2 The Customer will pay each invoice in full within 30 days of receipt
	(or such other period as the parties may agree in the Order Form).
</p>
<p>
	7.3 All Charges are exclusive of VAT. Where VAT is payable in respect of
	any Charges, Snowplow will add VAT to its invoice at the appropriate rate,
	and the Customer will pay such VAT together with such Charges.
</p>
<p>
	7.4 If the Customer has not paid an invoice by its due date for payment,
	Snowplow may charge interest, from the date on which payment was due until
	the actual date of payment (whether before or after judgment), at a rate of
	1 per cent. per month above the official dealing rate of the Bank of
	England, accruing daily. The Customer will pay the accrued interest
	together with the overdue amount.
</p>
<p>
	7.5 The Customer will pay all amounts due to Snowplow under this Agreement
	in full and without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding
	(other than any deduction or withholding of tax required by law, in respect
	of which the Customer will make the relevant payment to the relevant tax
	authority and provide Snowplow with the appropriate certification that it
	has done so, such that Snowplow can recover the withheld amounts under
	applicable double taxation treaties).
</p>
<p>
	7.6 With effect from the start of any Further Term, Snowplow may adjust the
	Charges by not less than 45 days’ notice in writing to the Customer. For
	clarity, any adjustment to the Charges is without prejudice to the
	Customer’s right to elect not to renew under clause 16.1.
</p>
<h2>
	8. Representations and Warranties
</h2>
<p>
	8.1 Each of Snowplow and the Customer represents and warrants that:
</p>
<p>
	8.1.1 it is duly incorporated and validly existing;
</p>
<p>
	8.1.2 it has all necessary consents, approvals and authorities to enter
	into and perform this Agreement; and
</p>
<p>
	8.1.3 it is not insolvent or trading wrongfully, and has no reason to
	believe that it will become so during the Term.
</p>
<p>
	8.2 The Customer represents and warrants that the Customer Data does not
	contain any material which:
</p>
<p>
	8.2.1 is criminal, defamatory, obscene, otherwise unlawful, harassing of
	any person, or which tends to promote hatred or discrimination; or
</p>
<p>
	8.2.2 infringes the intellectual property rights or other rights of any
	party,
</p>
<p>
	and the Customer is deemed to repeat such representation and warranty on
	each occasion on which it processes (or causes to be processed) additional
	Customer Data using a Product.
</p>
<h2>
	9. Security
</h2>
<p>
	9.1 Snowplow will use reasonable care and skill to secure the Hosted
	Services. Snowplow will provide to the Customer such information about
	Snowplow’s security policies and practices as the Customer may reasonably
	request.
</p>
<p>
	9.2 Depending on the Product, Snowplow may have access to the Customer’s
	own Cloud Computing Platform infrastructure. In those cases, the Customer
	will ensure that it configures Snowplow’s access as specified by Snowplow
	and, in particular, grants no additional privileges to Snowplow. The
	Customer is solely responsible for, and will appropriately secure, its
	Cloud Computing Platform and associated access credentials, and Snowplow
	will have no liability to the Customer for any actual or suspected security
	breach in respect of the Customer’s Cloud Computing Platforms not directly
	caused by Snowplow’s breach of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
	9.3 Each of Snowplow and the Customer will keep the relevant account access
	credentials secure and will not disclose them to any other person. Where
	Snowplow and the Customer exchange access credentials, they will do so
	using an appropriate secure methodology or service. Each of Snowplow and
	the Customer will ensure that it uses that methodology or service correctly
	and in accordance with best security practice.
</p>
<h2>
	10. Data protection
</h2>
<p>
	10.1 If a Product requires Snowplow to process personal data on behalf of
	the Customer, the parties will enter into such data processing agreement as
	the parties, acting reasonably, may agree.
</p>
<h2>
	11. Intellectual Property
</h2>
<p>
	11.1 Nothing in this Agreement will change the ownership of any of the
	intellectual property rights of either party. In particular, the Customer
	acknowledges that the Products (including the Software) and Snowplow’s
	know-how and expertise in performing Support and/or Data Analytics and Data
	Engineering Services are the valuable property and/or confidential
	information of Snowplow and/or its licensors, and that it may not make any
	use of them other than in order to receive the benefit of the Products.
</p>
<p>
	11.2 The Customer acknowledges that Snowplow has no control over the nature
	or content of the Customer Data, and the Customer will therefore indemnify
	Snowplow against any claim brought by a third party against Snowplow on the
	basis that Customer Data infringes a third party’s rights (including its
	intellectual property rights).
</p>
<h2>
	12. Confidentiality
</h2>
<p>

<p>

	for the purpose of exercising its rights and performing its obligations
	under this Agreement;
</p>
<p>
	12.1.2 not disclose or make available the Confidential Information in whole
	or in part to any third party, except as permitted by this Agreement; and
</p>
<p>
	12.1.3 apply the same security measures and degree of care to the
	Confidential Information as the Receiving Party applies to its own
	confidential information (and which will in any event be no less stringent
	than the measures required by this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
	12.2 The Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential
	Information to those of its sub-contractors and its and their agents,
	officers, employees and professional advisers who need to know it in
connection with this Agreement (each, a “	<strong>Permitted Disclosee</strong>”), provided that:
</p>
<p>
	12.2.1 it informs each Permitted Disclosee of the confidential nature of
	the Confidential Information before disclosure; and
</p>
<p>
	12.2.2 it procures that each Permitted Disclosee will comply with this
	clause 12 as if it were the Receiving Party,
</p>
<p>
	and the Receiving Party will be liable for the failure of any Permitted
	Disclosee to comply with this clause 12.
</p>
<p>
		12.3 The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information:
</p>
<p>
	12.3.1 to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be
	disclosed by law, by any governmental or other regulatory authority with
	jurisdiction over the Receiving Party, or by a court of competent
	jurisdiction, provided in each case that, to the extent it is legally
	permitted to do so, it gives the Disclosing Party as much advance warning
	of such disclosure as possible and takes into account the reasonable
	requests of the Disclosing Party in relation to the content of that
	disclosure; and
</p>
<p>
	12.3.2 in the course of a proper due diligence process in furtherance of a
	bona fide acquisition, disposal, investment or similar corporate
	transaction (whether actual or proposed), to interested parties subject to
	obligations of confidentiality with respect to the Confidential Information
	which are no less onerous than those set out in this clause 12.
</p>
<h2>
	13. Liability
</h2>
<p>
	13.1 This clause 13 sets out Snowplow’s entire liability to the Customer
	under or in connection with this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
		13.2 Nothing in this agreement limits or excludes Snowplow's liability
		for:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	13.2.2 fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
</p>
<p>

	13.2, Snowplow will not have any liability to the Customer under or in

	profits; loss of sales or business; loss of agreements or contracts; loss

	loss of use or corruption of data or information; or any indirect or

	Customer under or in connection with this Agreement will be limited, in
	respect of all claims (connected or unconnected) in any consecutive 12
	month period, to an amount equal to the Charges paid by the Customer in
	that period.
</p>
<h2>
	14. Third Party infringement Claims
</h2>
<p>
		14.1 If a third party asserts a claim against the Customer that the
		Customers' use of a Product infringes that third party's intellectual
		property rights (an "<strong>Infringement Claim</strong>"), then
		Snowplow will, at its own expense, defend or settle the Infringement
		Claim and pay any damages finally awarded against the Customer, or any
		settlement amount agreed between that third party and Snowplow in lieu
		of such damages, but only if:
</p>
<p>
	14.1.1 the Customer promptly notifies Snowplow of such Infringement Claim
	(and in any event within an amount of time sufficient to permit Snowplow to
	take appropriate action within the applicable time limits) and takes no
	action to admit, settle or otherwise dispose of such Infringement Claim
	without Snowplow's prior written consent;
</p>
<p>
	14.1.2 Snowplow retains sole control of the defence of such Infringement
	Claim and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise (including free
	choice of counsel, other professional advisers and experts); and
</p>
<p>
	14.1.3 the Customer provides all reasonable assistance requested by
	Snowplow or its professional advisers,
</p>
<p>
	and in each case solely to the extent that the Infringement Claim is based
	on an allegation of infringement by some element of a Product.
</p>
<p>
	14.2 Snowplow’s obligations in clause 14.1 above will not apply if the
	Infringement Claim is wholly or mainly based on:
</p>
<p>
	14.2.1 use or distribution of a Product other than in accordance with this
	Agreement and Snowplow’s published user documentation;

<p>
	14.2.2 the combination of the relevant Product with products or services
	not provided by Snowplow;
</p>
<p>
	14.2.3 any modification or alteration of a Product by any person other than
	Snowplow;
</p>
<p>
	14.2.4 any Open Source Software; or
</p>

</p>
<p>
	14.3.1 modify the Product so as to avoid the infringement; or
</p>
<p>
	14.3.2 procure for the Customer from the third party right holder the right
	to continue sub-licensing the product,
</p>
<p>
	or, if neither of the above is (in Snowplow's reasonable opinion)
	commercially practicable, terminate the affected Order Form (or modify it
	so as to remove the infringing product from its scope) and refund the
	unused pro-rata portion of any corresponding Charges paid by the Customer,
	and Snowplow will have no further liability to the Customer in respect of

<h2>
	15. Force Majeure
</h2>
<p>
	15.1 A “<strong>Force Majeure Event</strong>” is any event or circumstance
	not within a party’s reasonable control, including (in the case of
	Snowplow) failures or outages at upstream or infrastructure suppliers
	(including but not limited to relevant Cloud Computing Platforms).

	15.2 Provided it has complied with clause 15.3, if a party is prevented,
	hindered or delayed in or from performing any of its obligations under this
	agreement by a Force Majeure Event (the “<strong>Affected Party</strong>”),
	the Affected Party will not be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise
	liable for any such failure or delay in the performance of such
	obligations. The time for performance of such obligations shall be extended
	accordingly, and the corresponding obligations of the other party will be
	suspended, and its time for performance of such obligations extended, to
	the same extent as those of the Affected Party.
</p>
<p>
	15.3 The Affected Party will:
</p>
<p>
	15.3.1 as soon as reasonably practicable after the start of the Force
	Majeure Event, notify the other party of the Force Majeure Event, the date
	on which it started, its likely or potential duration, and the effect of
	the Force Majeure Event on its ability to perform any of its obligations
	under the agreement; and
</p>
<p>
	15.3.2 use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effect of the Force
	Majeure Event on the performance of its obligations.
</p>
<p>
	15.4 If the Force Majeure Event prevents, hinders or delays the Affected
	Party's performance of its obligations for more than 30 days, the party not
	affected by the Force Majeure Event may terminate this agreement by written
	notice to the Affected Party.
</p>

	the meaning of the insolvency legislation applicable to that party;
</p>
<p>
	16.2.4 a person (including the holder of a charge or other security
	interest) is appointed to manage or take control of the whole or part of

	such a person is given or documents relating to such an appointment are
	filed with any court;
</p>
<p>
	16.2.5 the ability of the other party's creditors to take any action to
	enforce their debts is suspended, restricted or prevented or some or all of
	that party's creditors accept, by agreement or pursuant to a court order,
	an amount of less than the sums owing to them in satisfaction of those
	sums; or
</p>
<p>
	16.2.6 any process is instituted which could lead to the other party being
	dissolved and its assets being distributed to its creditors, shareholders
	or other contributors (other than for the purposes of solvent amalgamation
	or reconstruction).

<h2>
	17. General
</h2>
<p>
  17.1 Snowplow may, by notice in writing to the Customer (which may be by
  email), update these terms of business from time to time, for example to
  reflect changes in law or best practice, or changes in how its business
  operates. If the Customer raises a reasonable objection to such changes, and
  Snowplow is unable to resolve that objection to the Customer’s reasonable
  satisfaction, then the Customer may by notice to Snowplow terminate this
  Agreement.
</p>
<p>
	17.2 This Agreement (and the documents referred to in it) constitutes the
	entire agreement, and supersedes any previous agreement, between the
	parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
	17.3 Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on or been induced to
	enter this Agreement by a representation, warranty or undertaking (whether
	contractual or otherwise) other than those expressly set out in this
	Agreement.
</p>
<p>
	17.4 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, any failure to
	exercise or delay in exercising (whether fully or at all) a right or remedy
	provided by this Agreement or by law does not constitute a waiver of the
	right or remedy or a waiver of any other rights or remedies.
</p>
<p>
	17.5 A notice under or in connection with this Agreement: must be in
	writing; must be in the English language; and must be delivered personally
	or sent by email or first class post to the party due to receive the notice

	specified in the Order Form (in the case of the Customer).
</p>
<p>
	17.6 A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the
	Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this
	Agreement.
</p>
<p>
	17.7 Snowplow may subcontract the performance of all or part of this
	Agreement, but as between Snowplow and the Customer, Snowplow will remain
	liable for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors as if they were the
	acts or omissions of Snowplow itself (and subject therefore to the
	limitations and exclusions of liability set out in this Agreement).
</p>
<p>
	17.8 This Agreement and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or
	in connection with it are governed by English law and subject to the
	exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.
