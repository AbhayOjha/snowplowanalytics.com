                        <p>As data and analytics teams become critical to supporting more diverse, complex and mission-critical business processes, many are challenged with scaling the work they do in delivering data to support a range of consumers and use cases. Pressure to deliver faster, with higher quality and with resiliency in the face of constant change, is causing data and analytics leaders to rethink how their teams are organized and how they work. Traditional waterfall-oriented methodologies aren’t meeting the need — the distance between requirements definition and delivery of value is too great, the time required too long, and too many critical tasks get lost or degraded across role and team silos.</p>
                        <p>DataOps techniques can address these challenges through a more agile, collaborative and change-friendly approach to building and managing data pipelines.</p>
                        <p>Read this report by Ted Friedman and Nick Heudecker at Gartner to get a better understanding of what DataOps is and why you need it to improve your data management discipline. </p>
