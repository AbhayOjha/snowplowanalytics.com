      content: Conducting an A/B test is more complicated than just randomly assigning users into groups. To run a meaningful experiment requires meticulous planning around what experiment is run, what the expected impact of the experiment will be, and what metrics will best capture that impact. It is essential that the process of running the tests, measuring the results, and making the decision whether or not to roll out each product update is as frictionless as possible.

      content: Lifecake, a service for family members to collect, share, and celebrate memories, wants to use data to make sure that they’re improving the service for their users, while growing their user base, over time. They were spending a lot on acquiring new customers, but their user base wasn’t growing as fast as they were expecting. After the first round of analysis on their product data, a retention analysis showed that a huge percentage of users dropped Lifecake after day one.

      content: "We released new versions of the Snowplow iOS and Android SDKs. These new versions deliver a data set that is significantly easier to model and work with: helping companies use mobile data to better inform product development and marketing decisions. In this post, we’ll explain how the data delivered by these new mobile trackers is both easier to work with and better enables analysts, data scientists, marketers and product managers to do more with that data."
