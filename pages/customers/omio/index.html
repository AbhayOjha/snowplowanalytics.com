              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Key results</h3>
                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>Omio took advantage of Snowplow’s modular infrastructure to create a fully customized pipeline, part Snowplow, part self-build for complete control and flexibility</li>
                  <li>With Snowplow’s robust validation step, Omio gained significant time-savings by solving data quality issues before they escalate</li>
                  <li>Using high quality Snowplow data enables Omio to drive a self-serve data culture across multiple data teams and use cases</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>As their data demands increased, Omio recognized they needed a solution that enabled them to share data with key data consumers – data scientists, products teams and analysts, while ensuring a high standard of data quality. The solution needed to align with the company’s move to an efficient, self-serve data culture, with enough flexibility to give Omio complete control and ownership of their data and data infrastructure. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>After mapping out their requirements, Omio found their blueprint for a potential self-built pipeline closely resembled Snowplow. After more discovery, it became clear that Omio could take advantage of Snowplow’s modular infrastructure to keep key components, such as Snowplow’s validation stage, while utilizing Omio infrastructure where required. The result was a hybrid solution: part Snowplow, part Omio, that enabled Omio to capture complete, accurate data that meets their high quality data requirements. In the near term, Omio are looking to leverage of Snowplow’s multi-cloud functionality to migrate from AWS to GCP, as they continue to drive a quality-first, self-serve data culture across the business.</p>
