        <p class="text-muted">PEAK is a cognitive training platform with a difference: it collaborates with neuroscientists and psychologists at Yale, Cambridge and other universities to build advanced games to exercise mental skills such as memory, mental agility, problem-solving, language and more. It turns your smartphone into a system for brain measurement, brain tracking and brain training.</p>

                    <h3>Peak’s app has over 20 million downloads since its launch in late 2014 and was voted Apple’s “Best App of 2014” and Google Play’s “Best of 2015” and “Best of 2016”.</h3>

                    <h2>Data-driven neuroscience</h2>
                    <p>Data is at the heart of the science behind Peak. Every game is personalised to build players’ skills as efficiently as possible and sophisticated normalisation of scores helps compare your progress to your friends'.</p>

With our academic partners, we are unlocking a new chapter in cognitive research by studying game scores and cognitive learning for millions of users. Snowplow is an integral part of that</i></q> - Thomas in’t Veld</p>
