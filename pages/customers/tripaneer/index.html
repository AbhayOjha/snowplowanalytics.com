                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>Tripaneer were able to optimize their marketing spend by using event-level data to accurately attribute revenue to each campaign.</li>
                  <li>With greater access to their data and complete freedom to track any event, Tripaneer were better able to experiment and carry out A/B tests </li>
                  <li>By stitching together data from multiple sources and devices alongside historic logs, Tripaneer get a complete view of the end-to-end customer journey</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Tripaneer quickly outgrew their homegrown data collection solution with the huge volumes of data they were gathering. Tripaneer needed to accurately attribute data from a range of marketing channels, including Google, Bing, Facebook, display ads and their own affiliate program. Without a way to centralize their marketing data, Tripaneer received data from each platform that didn't add up. They needed a solution to provide a clear view of campaign and ad-level data to help them decide where best to allocate resources.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>Using Snowplow, Tripaneer have unprecedented level of control, accuracy, and transparency over their data. With event-level tracking in real-time, Tripaneer can monitor and eventually predict customer intent. As a result, they can access the complete picture of their customer journey, optimize their ad spend and offer more personalized experiences. </p>
