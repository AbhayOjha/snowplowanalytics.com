                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>JustWatch built their own anonymous identity management service on top of their Snowplow data to successfully identify users across channels, and target specific users across any channel</li>
                  <li>JustWatch used their Snowplow data to develop superior user intelligence and build profiles around 50 million movie fans</li>
                  <li>Using Snowplow’s data, JustWatch was able to optimize trailer delivery and double watch time compared to  the industry average</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>JustWatch serves targeted video content to consumers, while also allowing movie studios to advertise TV shows and movies to highly defined audience segments. To improve user experience and targeting, JustWatch needed access to detailed data about their user base so they could track activity across platforms and gain an understanding of users’ tastes in movies and TV shows. Then, JustWatch would be able to match users with customized trailers and TV show suggestions through sophisticated machine learning models, and increase the efficiency of movie studios’ trailer advertising campaigns.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>JustWatch implemented Snowplow to collect rich, granular, event-level data across various channels, which made it possible for JustWatch to stitch together user journeys and deliver a single customer view. Then, on top of the advanced user intelligence gained through Snowplow data, JustWatch built an audience tech that enabled studios to advertise with an unprecedented level of control and precision, increasing return on ad spend. What’s more, JustWatch’s team of data scientists were able to power machine learning models and clustering algorithms with their Snowplow data to match users with targeted content.</p>
