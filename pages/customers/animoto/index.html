                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>Animoto were able to join together their online, mobile and other data in a single place to gain a new level of user insight</li>
                  <li>Using Snowplow, Animoto built custom, data and multi-touch attribution models tailored specifically to their business needs</li>
                  <li>Animoto took advantage of their raw, granular data to gain a greater understanding of their user journey prior to registration, allowing them to optimize their acquisition funnel</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Animoto’s data needs were growing and their existing solution, Google Analytics, was too restrictive and lacked the tracking capability to tell Animoto’s full data story. They were also unable to set up universal tracking across their platforms, which made it impossible to see the end-to-end user journey. With the company’s move to freemium and their increased focus on mobile adoption, Animoto needed a solution that would help them to see exactly how their users interacted with their product and enable them to optimize the overall user experience.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>With Snowplow, Animoto could collect complete, accurate, well-structured data across their platforms and devices. This meant they could move away from data silos and unify their data, giving them a much clearer picture of their user journey. Snowplow’s flexibility and the ability to create customized data and attribution models was especially crucial to understanding user behavior and discovering what users were doing both before and after they sign-up to Animoto as customers.</p>
