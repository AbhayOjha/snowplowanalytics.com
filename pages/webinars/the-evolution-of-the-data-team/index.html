                        <p>There is no denying that growing a data team has it’s challenges. What you plan your data team structure to look like initially may not turn out to be the most effective long term. Building a well balanced skill set within your data team and evolving the function alongside the business to ensure continuous growth is no easy feat. </p> 
                        <br>  
                        <p>In this webinar, we will unpack how data team structures have evolved, drawing on examples from our customers and specifically from the data team at Hudl. Mindy Chen, Director of Decision Science at Hudl will take us on a journey through the challenges and opportunities she has seen when building a data team from scratch.</p>
                        <p>Growing from 3 data engineers to a robust team of 20, <a href="https://www.hudl.com/en_gb/">Hudl</a> has been on a journey to establish their data capability. What started out as an experiment working on data ingestion has evolved into one of Hudl’s key competitive advantages. Over the past 4 and a half years, the data team at Hudl has moved through several stages of evolution, leading to great successes as well as some important lessons which Mindy will share with us.</p>
