<p>For information on what data we collect during our recruitment process, please see the <a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/privacy-policy/recruitment/">Recruitment Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>How we use that data</h2>

<p>There are two ways we use the data that that we collect:</p>

<h3>1. To optimise the effectiveness of our website</h3>

<p>Our website is a resource for:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Prospective users of our technology and services</b>, who are interested in learning more so that they can make well-informed buying decisions.</b></li>
		<li><b>Current users of our technology (including open source technology) and services</b>, who are interested in getting more information so that they can effectively use our technology and services.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Ensuring that our website serves the needs of both of the above groups of visitors is important both for visitors to our websites (they get a good experience) and ourselves (so we can win and retain customers). By looking at what content people consume on our website we can get an idea of where they require help or better information. Based on the sequence of pages they visit we can identify if we're successfully sharing information in a logical, easy-to-follow manner.</p>

<h3>2. To market to prospective and current Snowplow users</h3>

<p>A certain subset of visitors to our website are prospective rather than current Snowplow users, who have come to our website to learn more about our technology and services. Other visitors to our website include people who use either Snowplow technology, services or both.</p>

<p>For users whose email addresses we have because they have shared them with us via one of the webforms on our website, we use those email addresses to send targeted marketing. The purpose of the marketing is to inform those people about topics related to our technology and services that we think are relevant and helpful. We try and predict what information is helpful based on the data we've collected on each of those visitors such as what content on our website they have read, or which emails we have sent them in the past that they have opened and clicked on. For example, if someone on our website has shown an interest in GDPR-related content, and we have just released some new functionality to help them meet their obligations under GDPR, we would like to be able to send them that information in an email.</p>

<p>It is very important to us that we <i>only</i> send additional information to users who are happy to receive the information, and in the event that an individual no longer wishes to receive targeted communciation from us, we stop sending that information and remove their data if requested. More information on how we do this in practice can be found <a href="#how-we-ensure-data-use-is-used-correctly">below</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to emailing visitors to our website who have shared their email address with us with targeted marketing emails, we also remarket to visitors o our website via ad networks including LinkedIn, Facebook, Google and Bing. To do this, we load pixels from these third party providers that enable them to identify who has visited our website and then send just those users particular ads via their networks. Again, the purpose is to send target people we know are interested in particular content based on their behaviour on our website, with ads for other items of content we think would be useful for them. </p>

<h2 id="how-we-ensure-data-use-is-used-correctly">How we ensure that our use of all data collected is compatible with the rights and preferences of our website visitors</h2>

<p>There are several methods we use to ensure that our use of all data we collect is compatible with the rights and preferences of our website visitors. These measures are listed below. They are continually reviewed and developed as we identify opportunities to better manage and control the use of our data for the benefits of our website visitors.</p>

<h3>We are clear and upfront with visitors on our website about what data we collect and how we use that data</h3>

<p>We do our best to be clear and transparent about what data we collect and how we use it. This page is a big part of how we do that. In additon wherever we collect e.g. email addresses and other PII we try and make it as clear possible what data we're collecting and how we use it.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our use of that data please <a href="/company/contact-us/">get in touch and let us know.</a></p>

<h3>We respond in a timely way to all requests from individuals to stop being contacted, "to be forgotten", or to requests by individuals to see the data that we have collected from them.</h3>

<p>If you have engaged with us in any way and no longer want us to be in touch, or to keep any data of any engagement you have had with us, please <a href="/company/contact-us/">let us know</a>. We will endevour either to stop contacting you or to remove all the data we have on you, as requested, as quickly as possible.</p>
