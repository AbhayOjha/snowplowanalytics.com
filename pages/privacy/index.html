<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<small>Last updated: 15 May 2018</small>

<p>Note: this document explains what data we collect from visitors to our website and how that data is used. It also explains how visitors to our website can request more information or request to have their personal information removed from our systems.</p>

<p>If you are looking for information on how we work with Snowplow Insights clients to safeguard their data, please see our <a href="/terms-of-service/data-protection-agreement/">Data Processing Agreement</a>. For information on the third-party service providers we use to deliver the Snowplow Insights service and manage the data that we collect please see our <a href="/terms-of-service/snowplow-sub-processors/">List of Sub-Processors.</a></p>

<h2>What data we collect</h2>

<p>When you visit our website, <code>https://snowplowanalytics.com</code> and other subdomains owned and run by Snowplow Analytics Limited (company number 07852221 with registered office is at The Rome Building, 32-38 Scrutton Street, London, EC2A 4RQ, United Kingdom), we track:
	<ul>
		<li>The following personal-identifiable information about you: 
			<li>your IP address and </li>
			<li>your device (cookie ID).</li> 
			<li>For users who submit their email address via our webforms (e.g. to sign up to a demo or ask or answer ask a question on our forums) we also track the information submitted in those forms e.g. your name and email address, the question you have asked or the answer you have given.</li>
		</li>
		<li>The following addition metadata about you:
			<li>information about the type device you are accessing our website from including information about the browser and operating system.</li>
			<li>Where you are located (based on your IP address.</li>
			<li>What web pages you have visited, including how long you have spent on each page.</li>
		</li> 

	</ul>
</p>

<p>For people who are signed up to our mailing list, we track:
	<ul>
		<li>Which emails we have sent you.</li>
		<li>Which emails you open.</li>
		<li>Which links in those emails you click.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>How we use that data</h2>

<p>There are three ways we use the data that that we collect:</p>

<h3>1. To optimise the effectiveness of our website</h3>

<p>Our website is a resource for:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Prospective users of our technology and services</b>, who are interested in learning more so that they can make well-informed buying decisions.</b></li>
		<li><b>Current users of our technology (including open source technology) and services, who are interested in getting more information so that they can effectively use our technology and services.</b></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Ensuring that our website serves the needs of both of the above groups of visitors is important both for visitors to our websites (they get a good experience) and ourselves (so we can win and retain customers).</p>

<h3>2. To market to prospective users who are interested in learning more about our technology and services</h3>

<p>A certain subset of visitors to our website are prospective rather than current Snowplow users, who have come to our website to learn more about our technology and services.</p>

<p>For these users who are interested, we want to be able to send them additional information: for example, if they have consumed information about data protection and GDPR, and we have just released some new functionality to help them meet their obligations under GDPR, we would like to be able to send them that information in an email.</p>

<p>It is very important to us that we <i>only</i> send additional information to users who are happy to receive the information, and in the event that an individual no longer wishes to receive targeted communciation from us, we stop sending that information and remove their data if requested. More information on how we do this in practice can be found <a href="#how-we-ensure-data-use-is-used-correctly">below</a>.</p>

<h3>3. To send relevant resources to existing users to empower them to use our technology and services more effectively.</h3>

<p>A certain subset of visitors to our website our current rather than prospective Snowplow users, who have come to our website to learn more about how to effectively use our technology and services.</p>


<p>For those users who are interested, we want to be able to send them additional information that would assist them meeting their goals. For example, if we can see that they have consumed content about different approaches to attribution, we would like to send them any new information we publish on attribution for example recipes for deploying new attribution models.</p>

<p>It is very important to us that we <i>only</i> send additional information to users who are happy to receive the information, and in the event that an individual no longer wishes to receive targeted communciation from us, we stop sending that information and remove their data if requested. More information on how we do this in practice can be found <a href="#how-we-ensure-data-use-is-used-correctly">below</a>.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-ensure-data-use-is-used-correctly">How we ensure that our use of all data collected is compatible with the rights and preferances of our website visitors</h2>

<p>There are several methods we use to ensure that our use of all data collected is compatible with the rights and preferences of our website visitors. These measures are listed below. They are continually reviewed and developed as we identify opportunities to better manage and control the use of our data for the benefits of our website visitors.</p>

<h3>We make extensive use of pseudo-anonymization, so that we expose personal identifiable information as little as possible</h3>

<p>The first use case for the data collected from our website: to optimize the effectiveness of our website for our website visitors, does not require that we store personal identifiable information. For example, it we know that a particular guide to identity stitching is popular, that is helpful in guiding decisions about other guides that we need to write. We do not need to know <i>who</i> that content was popular with, only that it is popular. For this reason, we pseudo-anonymize all the personal identifiable information before we make it available to our team members to process for this purpose. This means that they can work with the data to optimise our website, and the experience we deliver to our users, without revealing any personal identifiable information to them.</p>

<p>For that reason, we pseudo-anonymize all the personal identifiable information collected into the data warehouse that is the store of all the data that we use to optimize our website.</p>

<p>Please note that the details of any forms submitted are pseudo-anonymized before being loaded into our data warehouse but are sent directly into our CRM or email marketing system without being anonymized so that we can take the relevant follow up action e.g. arranging demo with a prospective user who has requested one.</p>

<p>Any posts made on our forum (on <a href="https://discourse.snowplowanalytics.com">discourse.snopwlowanalytics.com</a>) are stored with all the account metadata generated when the visitor created his/her forum account. This data is not pseudo-anonymized either. We believe that by making it possible for users of our forums to see who is posting questions and answers, it will encourage higher quality dicussion and collaboration amongst our community of users, prospective users, team and partners.</p>

<p>The only data that is not pseudo-anonymized </p>

<h3>We only send marketing and other material to website visitors who have explicitly shared their contact details with us</h3>

<p>For example, if you submit your name and email address on a web form requesting that you would like a demo of our technology, we will use that information to schedule a demo with you. We will not reach out to website visitors who have not submitted their details.</p>

<h3>We will ensure that we use the data </h3>


<p>Blah</p>

<h2>How you can control how we use your data, after we have collected it, including having exercising your right to be forgotten.</h2>

<p>Blah.</p>

<p>We pseudo-anonymize all the personal identifiable information</p>

		We use this information to tie the information we receive from you into a complete picture of the actions you've taken on our website.</li>
		<li>Which pages on our website you visit, and how long you spend on each.</li>
		<li>Any actions you take on a page e.g. PDFs you download or webforms you fill in.</li>
		<li>Where you fill in a webform, we record the details that you leave. Note that this will often include personal identifiable information like your name or email address. (But only if you explicitly share these with us through the webform.)</li>
	</ul>
