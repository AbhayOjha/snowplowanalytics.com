# Snowplow Analytics Recruitment Privacy Notice 

As part of our recruiting process, we collect candidate data in order to assess an individual’s suitability for a role at Snowplow. We are committed to being transparent as to how we collect, process and use that data. 

## What information do we collect?

When you apply for a job at Snowplow, you will usually be asked to fill out an online application form and upload your CV. You may also be asked to provide your name and contact details such as your email address, telephone number and address. We ask you to provide this information so that we’re able to get in touch with you about the job and throughout the recruiting process.

You may also be asked to provide your educational background, qualifications, previous employment and details of skills. This is so that we can more accurately assess your suitability for a particular role at Snowplow. 

Depending on your location and where applicable, we may also ask you to provide information about your entitlement to work in the UK, as it is mandatory to check a successful applicant's eligibility to work in the UK before employment commences.

Please note that on your CV, you may supply information that we have not specifically asked you to provide but which we may store as part of your application.

## Why do we process candidates’ personal data?

Snowplow has a legitimate interest in collecting, storing and processing candidates’ personal data for recruitment purposes. We need this information to manage the recruitment process, make informed decisions throughout that process and confirm a candidate’s suitability for a position.

## Who has access to your data?

Your data may be stored in a variety of different places, including our Applicant Tracking System and other IT systems, such as email. 

For recruiting purposes, your information may be shared internally with members of the HR & Recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process and other managers within the organisation with a relevant job role.

Your data will not be shared with a third party unless your application is successful and you are made an offer of employment. At this point, your information may be shared with former employers to obtain references for you, as well as employment background check providers to obtain any necessary background checks. We will inform you that we are doing this.


## How long will we store candidates’ personal data for?

We have decided on a data retention period that balances the rights of you (the data subject) with Snowplow’s business needs/interests, as well as any potential risks.

We will retain your candidate personal data for a maximum of 12 months from the point of your first application. The reason we have chosen this time period is that we may wish to contact you in the future regarding other suitable job opportunities at Snowplow. At the end of the 12 month period, or whenever you choose to withdraw your consent, your data will either be deleted or anonymised in our Applicant Tracking System. 

If your application is successful, any personal data collected during the recruitment process will be transferred to your HR file and retained during your employment with Snowplow. You will be provided with a separate privacy notice to cover your period of employment. 


## What are your rights as a data subject?

The GDPR provides you (the data subject) with the following rights:

* To access and obtain a copy of your data on request;  
* To require the organisation to rectify incorrect data;  
* To withdraw consent and require the organisation to erase or stop processing your data;
* To object to the processing of your data where the organisation is relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact Miriam de Medwe at miriam@snowplowanalytics.com.
