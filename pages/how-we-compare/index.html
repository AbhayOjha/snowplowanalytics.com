  - name: Packaged analytics providers
    content: Packaged analytics providers like Google and Adobe provide powerful tools for analysts and marketers to understand the behavior of users on websites and mobile applications. Increasingly, these platforms also support making the underlying data that power their UIs available to you in your data warehouse. However, for these providers the underlying data is a byproduct of the UIs and hence their business logic bleeds into the data. Unlike with Snowplow Insights, you’re stuck with their one-size fits all data structures and data models which may not be appropriate for your business. Lastly, these vendors do not support the evolution of your data collection with your web and mobile apps, making them brittle sources of data.

          Other technologies, including some digital analytics tools, CDPs and ETL-as-a-service vendors offer alternative ways to collect data from e.g. websites and mobile apps.
