<h2 id="control-plane">1. Control-Plane</h2>

In the Snowplow Mini v0.2.2,  every internal problem or updating schema registry requires restarting the machine or making SSH connection and restarting all the applications. We know that this is not a easy process. For solving this problem, with this release we are announcing Snowplow Mini Control Plane. First feature of the control plane is restarting the all the Snowplow Mini services with one button. With this button, you don't need to SSH to machine or restarting machine after every update to the schema registry. Only thing you need to do is clicking this button. 
Also, we are planning add [more features] [control-plane-issue] to the control-plane in the next releases.


<h2 id="out-of-the-box-ssl">2. Out-Of-The-Box SSL</h2>

Snowplow Mini is coming out-of-the-box SSL after [number of requests] [ssl-requests-issue] in this release. With out-of-the-box SSL, you can use Snowplow Mini as the collector for websites with SSL. Only thing you need to is submitting the domain name which redirects to the ip of the server Snowplow Mini will run and your SSL protected Snowplow Mini is ready. You can look at the [corresponding part] [submitting-domain-name] in the Quickstart Guide for learning how to submit domain name to Snowplow Mini.


<h2 id="http-auth">3. HTTP authentication while accessing internal application</h2>

With this release, you don't need to open the ports to the outside for accessing applications on the Snowplow Mini. Every applications have a unique url path and you can access these applications with username and password which you choose in the beginning of the Snowplow Mini setup.


<h2 id="easier-setup">4. Much more easier setup for local development</h2>

With this release, local setup of the Snowplow Mini is made much more easier for local development and testing. Only thing you need to do is fetching Snowplow Mini repository and calling 'vagrant up' in the main folder of the repository. Your running Snowplow-Mini instance is ready with only one command.


<h2 id="basic-enrichments">5. Basic enrichments as standard</h2>

One of the strong features of the Snowplow is enrichments. You can read more about enrichments in [here][enrichments-info]. With this release, Snowplow Mini is coming with 6 of these enrichments. These enrichments are: 

* IP lookups
* Campaign attribution enrichment
* Referer parser
* ua-parser
* user-agent-utils
* event fingerprint

We are planning to add new feature for adding enrichments from UI, stay tunned.
