It’s the end of the year and the end of the decade and we’ve been thinking a lot about which songs shaped the last 10 years for each of us. 

This month Spotify released a list of the top listened to artists of the decade, which included: Drake, Ed Sheeran, Adele, Macklemore, Shakira and Mark Ronson, just to name a few. Here are our top picks of the decade:

**The 1975 - Chocolate (2012)**

*“This song came out while I was working at Apple. We all loved it and played it constantly back of house. It wasn't an easy time for me but every time I hear this song I can't help but smile, start tapping my feet and dance like an idiot.”* **Simon - Content Marketer**  



**Twenty One Pilots - Trees (2012)**

*“Trees means so much to me that I got the lyrics tattooed on me. This song is awesome when played live too; so much energy and emotion!”* **Nicki - Office Manager**  



**Tash Sultana - Jungle (2016)**

*“It was the first song I ever heard of hers and her music has been a constant part of my life ever since - through travel, breakups, house moves, work highs and lows. I'm going to see her for the fifth time next year and it's fair to say that she is my absolute favourite artist of all time.”*  **Miriam - People Operations Manager**



**Idina Menzel - Let it go (2013) - Rich - Global Account Manager**



**Psy - Gangnam Style (2012) - Alex B - Mobile Engineer**



**Tool - Fear Inoculum (2019)**

*“After 13 years of no albums from them, although everything is different in my life now, it was great to go back in time when they were a big part music shuffle.”* **Mike N - Insights Product Manager**



**Imagine Dragons - Radioactive (2012)**

*“I don't know much 10's music, I think I'm stuck in the 80s, 90s and 00s. But this is one of the only artists me and my wife both like. We’ve seen them at The o2 Arena and Kendrick Lamar's part on the remix is talent.”* **Mike J - Product Designer**

**Daft Punk -  Contact (2013) - Costas - Data Engineer**



**Estelle - American Boy (2011) - Lalsa - Customer Success Specialist**



**John Grant - Queen of Denmark (2010) - Erika - Technical Content Writer**



**Pendulum - Crush (2011) - Daniel - Frontend Developer**



**Radiohead - Burn The Witch (2016) - Oguzhan - Data Engineer**



**Six60 - Rest Of You (2011)**

*“Obviously had to go for a NZ song, but this particular album was one I listened to a lot when I moved to the UK, and then again shared the love for it with my colleagues when I worked in France - I see Six60 live every time they tour the UK. Rest Of You is a song I listen to whenever I need a little fix of kiwiland - the whole Gold album is amazing. Ask any kiwi you know.“* **Sophie - Events Coordinator**



**Run The Jewels ft. Zach De la Rocha - Close Your Eyes (2014) Piotr - Data Engineer**



**The Burning Hell - Amateur Rappers (2013) - James - Product Engineer**



**Stormzy - Shut Up (2015)**

*“When you're having a bad day, need to forget about the haters out there, and tell people to go away, you just need to bang this tune out. Also a good gateway into the UK grime scene!”* **Nick - TechOps Engineer**



**Bastille - Quarter Past Midnight (2019)**

*“I remember going for a drive when I put Bastille’s new album for the first time and this is the opening song. What a great driving song to open with, and it's become a playlist regular to forget about all my worries when going for a drive.”* **Paul - Solutions Engineer**



**Kanye West - Runaway (2010)**

*“An epic 9 minute track full of contradictions, just like the artist. Without a doubt one of the best songs of the decade, off the best album of the decade, 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'.”* **Julian - Business Development Manager**



**Jess Glynne - Don't Be So Hard On Yourself (2015)**

*“A big fat, in my face reminder of not to be too hard on myself! It shook me out of feeling stressed and anxious without fail when I started my first full-time job after uni - I would listen to it whilst walking to the station until I was singing, dancing and smiling down the road. Thank you Jess Glynne!”* **Claire - Customer Success Specialist**
