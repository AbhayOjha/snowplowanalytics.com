At the heart of building out the Snowplow company and product is a deep and abiding commitment to our users, helping them collect and own their customer data. In our quest to build a best-in-class customer data pipeline, we have always kept our user - data teams - at heart. Today we have reached an exciting milestone in our journey as we announce that [we’ve raised £4m in Series A funding](https://tech.eu/brief/snowplow-analytics-4-million-opensource-data-collection/) from research-led VC firm [MMC Ventures](https://www.mmcventures.com/). 

When Yali and I founded Snowplow back in 2012, our goal was to release data teams from the constraints of traditional analytics vendors. We knew that customer behavioral data needed to ‘break out’ from inside black-box solutions, and that data teams needed to own their own data. We saw early the potential of services from cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud to build out this capability for data teams in a truly cloud-native way. By creating an open source solution with Snowplow, we enabled data teams to collect, own and control their customer data in their own cloud environment. 

We launched Snowplow Insights in 2014 as a fully managed version of our open source software. This evolution let us further empower data teams with our transparent, customizable, flexible data pipeline, available across clouds. Today we have over 150 customers using the Snowplow product, working in a broad range of sectors and geographies, including Strava, The Economist, Weebly, Auto Trader, Omio and Secret Escapes. The Snowplow product has freed our customers from the limitations of other solutions or SaaS vendor lock-in.

Snowplow has been expanding rapidly in the US and Europe, and this funding - our first external capital - will help us have a wider impact and cement the trust that we’re establishing with customers and prospects in new territories. In addition, the investment will directly drive the development of our product capabilities and features - particularly those that help our data team customers to manage data quality, data meaning and data governance.  

Having reached this stage in our history independently, via bootstrapping, we were keen to partner with investors that understand our values and understand our customers’ pain points and challenges. In MMC Ventures, we are now working with an organization that shares our vision, understands how we have grown our technology and team and supports - both financially and philosophically - our ambitions for Snowplow’s future. We couldn’t be more excited for the next chapter in our journey!
