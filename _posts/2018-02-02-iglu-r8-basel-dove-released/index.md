We are excited to announce a new Iglu release, introducing a good number of improvements focused on our igluctl CLI tool.

1. [Switch from severity levels to granular linting](#skip-checks)
2. [Dealing with inconsistent schema versions](#missing-schema-versions)
3. [ZSTD compression support](#zstd)
4. [New linters](#new-linters)
5. [Setting ownership of Redshift tables](#set-owner)
6. [Other updates](#other-updates)
7. [Getting help](#help)

Read on for more information about Release 8 Basel Dove, named after [a Swiss postage stamp][basel-dove] - the first tricolor stamp in the world.

<h2 id="skip-checks">1. Switch from severity levels to granular linting</h2>

In [igluctl 0.2.0][iglu-r6-release] we introduced the concept of severity levels for our schema linting, to help schemas meet higher standards during the authoring process. However, time has shown that different use cases imply different ideas of "higher standards", and the lint levels approach lacks the flexibility required to cover all these use cases.

As of this release, igluctl always defaults to our previous strictest level (known before as `severityLevel 3`), but you can then explicitly switch off certain bundles of *checks* or *linters*.

To reduce the linting strictness, the `--skip-checks` accepts a list of comma-separated pre-defined linter names, for example:

{% highlight bash %}
$ igluctl lint --skip-checks descriptionPresent,optionalFields $SCHEMAS_PATH
{% endhighlight %}

The above linting will not notify user that some fields miss `description` property, and it will ignore that some fields are only implicitly optional (missing the `null` type that makes them explitly optional).

For the full list of available checks, their descriptions and their use cases, please see the [igluctl wiki page][igluctl-lint].

<h2 id="missing-schema-versions">2. Dealing with inconsistent schema versions</h2>

All schemas on Iglu Registries within single MODEL suppose to have a particular relation to each other and this relation is very important for proper DDL derivation, especially when it comes to column-oriented storages such as Amazon Redshift.
In other words, to generate proper non-breaking Redshift DDL, igluctl must be aware of all previously available source schemas.

Until Basel Dove it was possible to simply specify folder with only `1-0-1` schema in it and `static generate` would output DDL file assuming that this is the initial and single available schema.
At the same time if the initial and "lost" `1-0-0` schema didn't have some new columns added in `1-0-1` - these new columns will be mixed into the middle of DDL, effectively making DDL corrupted and migration impossible.

Starting from Basel Dove, it is almost impossible to generate this corrupted DDL by mistake.
New igluctl adds following additional checks and associated alerts to prevent it:

* If user specified folder as input and among schemas there's no 1-0-0 or any other schemas in between - refuse to do anything (but proceed with `--force` option at your own risk)
* If user specified full path to file with schema and this file is not 1-0-0 - print a warning
* In all other cases - proceed as usual

This also can be considered as one more step towards consistent registries and therefore proper DDL migrations.

<h2 id="zstd">3. ZSTD compression support</h2>

In [Snowplow R95 Ellora][snowplow-r95] we migrated our [atomic.events][atomic-events] table to much anticipated [ZSTD encoding][zstd], which had big positive impact on used storage space.

As of Basel Dove, ZSTD is now default encoding in DDL files generated by igluctl, thanks to [Mike Robbins][miike] of Snowflake Analytics, who drives the whole ZSTD effort in Snowplow stack.

There's no special configuration required, all existing tables with LZO encoding will work as before.
However, please note that if you want to migrate existing tables to ZSTD you will have to write and execute these migration script yourself.
Example `atomic.events` migration can be found in [snowplow repository][atomic-events-migration].

<h2 id="new-linters">4. New linters</h2>

Some more work has been done in igluctl 0.4.0 to improve litning mechanism, particularly following two new linters were added.

<h3 id="missing-linter">4.1 Linting missing schema versions</h3>

Beside of already mentioned warnings in `static generate` command, `lint` command will now also warn about missing schema versions.
This new linting feature is considered required and can not be excluded through `--skip-checks`.

<h3 id="description-linter-2">4.2 Linting description</h3>

[Mike Robbins][miike] of Snowflake Analytics came up with the proposal and PR for making sure fields have a human-readable `description` property in order to make schemas more maintainable.

<h2 id="set-owner">5. Setting ownership of Redshift tables</h2>

It is frequently forgotten to set owner of Redshift tables after generating DDLs.
With this release, we are introducing `--set-owner` parameter to igluctl's `static generate` command. 
It is provided with a string and igluctl will append an `ALTER TABLE` statement at the end of DDL, making sure that owner is present immediately after DDL generated.

<h2 id="other-updates">6. Other updates</h2>

R8 Basel Dove brings a few small adjustments too.

The header part of igluctl-generated Redshift DDLs contains an auto-generated comment section with project-related information. As of this release, it will contain the DDL generation time in UTC, instead of local time.

Basel Dove also fixes [an important bug][issue-313] in igluctl, which could, confusingly, generate incorrect failure messages even though the `static push` command had in fact executed successfully.

<h2 id="help">7. Getting help</h2>
