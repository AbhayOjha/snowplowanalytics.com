On March 29th, we were excited to host members of the digital analytics community at [Runway East][runway] for the return of the Snowplow Meetup to London for the fifth time.

We had three presentations, including two from organizations that have found success using the Snowplow pipeline to power their digital analytics.

[Metail][metail] aims to change the way we online shop for clothing by allowing customers to try on clothes online before they buy, increasing purchase confidence and reducing return rates. Data Engineer Gareth Rogers took us behind the scenes and gave us a guided tour through Metail’s unique analytics stack which employs [Amazon Redshift Spectrum][spectrum] to optimize their data querying.
