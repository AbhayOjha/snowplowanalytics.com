# Getting started with Snowplow

This serves as a high-level guide covering, in non-technical terms, what Snowplow is, what problems it can solve and how to best make use of it.

## What is Snowplow?

Snowplow is a data collection platform. It is software that you can install in your cloud environment (AWS or GCP) to collect rich and high quality data, delivered to your data warehouse.

You can use one of Snowplow’s 16 trackers in your website, app or server, or make use of a Snowplow webhook to capture third-party data. The Snowplow pipeline will deliver the data to a data warehouse of your choice. From there, you are free to use the data as you wish.

Snowplow puts you in full control of your data and empowers you to ask an answer any question of your data using whatever tool, method or technology you want.

## Why would I use Snowplow?

There are many reasons why we think companies should use Snowplow. We’ve compiled a short-list of what we believe are some of  the most compelling reasons:

1.  All your data lives in your own environment, not Snowplow’s, so you have unlimited access to and full control of all your event-level data.

2.  Your data is available in real-time (<3 seconds), which means you can build real-time applications on top of your data.

3.  Your data from all your platforms (web/mobile/server/emails/ad impressions) is structured in the same way and stored in the same place.


## What can I do with the data?

The short answer is; whatever you want. Snowplow puts you in full control of your data and empowers you to ask an answer any question of your data using whatever tool, method or technology you want.

Snowplow users and customers use our technology for a range of things and it really depends on their industry, business model and team size. Some common use cases include:

- Build a single customer view across web, mobile, offline and 3rd party channels
- Accurately measure, attribute and optimize marketing spend
- Understand the customer/user journey
- Use the data to power machine learning models and A/B tests
- Build real-time applications and automations on top of the data
