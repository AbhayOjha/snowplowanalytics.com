This serves as a high-level guide covering, in non-technical terms, what Snowplow is, what problems it can solve and how to best make use of it.

## GA360

Snowplow is a data collection platform. It is software that you can install in your cloud environment (AWS or GCP) to collect rich and high quality data, delivered to your data warehouse.

You can use one of Snowplow’s 16 trackers in your website, app or server, or make use of a Snowplow webhook to capture third-party data. The Snowplow pipeline will deliver the data to a data warehouse of your choice. From there, you are free to use the data as you wish.

Snowplow puts you in full control of your data and empowers you to ask an answer any question of your data using whatever tool, method or technology you want.
